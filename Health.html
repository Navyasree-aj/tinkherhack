            <h2>Menstrual Cycle</h2>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is a natural process that involves hormonal changes and physical changes in the uterus and ovaries. It's the time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next. </p>

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>On average, it lasts about 28 days, though it can be anywhere from 21 to 35 days. The cycle is divided into four phases: the menstrual phase, follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. The cycle ends when menstruation begins, signaling the start of a new cycle.</p>

            <h2>Hygiene</h2>
            <p>Pads: Use sanitary pads that absorb menstrual blood. They should be changed every 4-6 hours to prevent odor and infection.
                Menstrual Cups: A reusable option that collects menstrual blood. It should be emptied, cleaned, and reinserted every 12 hours.
                Always wash hands before and after handling sanitary products to maintain cleanliness.</p>

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Iron-rich foods: Blood loss during menstruation can lead to a drop in iron levels, so include foods like red meat, spinach, lentils, and fortified cereals to replenish iron.
                Vitamin B6: Found in bananas, potatoes, and chicken, it may help reduce bloating and mood swings.
                Omega-3 fatty acids: Present in fish, nuts, and seeds, these can help reduce inflammation and menstrual pain.
                Hydration: Drink plenty of water to prevent bloating and to stay hydrated, especially during heavy periods.
                Magnesium: Helps reduce cramps and muscle tension; foods like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens are good sources.</p>

            <h2>Pain Relief</h2>
            <p>Over-the-counter medications: NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen can relieve pain and inflammation.
                Heat therapy: A heating pad or hot water bottle placed on the lower abdomen can help relax muscles and ease pain.
                Exercise: Gentle activities like walking or yoga can improve blood circulation and reduce discomfort.
                Rest: Adequate sleep and relaxation can also alleviate stress and discomfort. If pain is severe or doesn't improve with these methods, itâ€™s best to consult a doctor.</p>
